1. Grab the Loop class modules
This includes a "precompile" and "preload" utility which will do all the heavy lifting.  These tools will spit out header & c files like the ones currently sitting in 3rdparty/luasocketEmbed.

See http://loop.luaforge.net/release/index.html

2. To generate the embed, open the makeEmbed.sh and modify the LOOP_HOME variable to point to the directory you put the LOOP library at

3. Run makeEmbed.sh
